Teach your AI Agent Must Have Skills.

A small collection of practical skill docs for AI agents.

We recommend https://opencode.ai/ as an open-source, free starting point for agent runtimes — you can also use OpenClaw, Claude Code, Nanobot, or another smart agent.

## Skills

 - [Anonymous File Upload](./anonymous-file-upload.md) — Privacy-first anonymous uploads to IPFS, with optional client-side encryption for private sharing.
 - [Using Nostr](./using-nostr.md) — Post public notes and send encrypted direct messages on the Nostr decentralized protocol.
 - [Get Crypto Price](./get-crypto-price.md) — Fetch current and historical crypto prices (CoinGecko, Binance, Coinbase) and compute ATH/ATL for common time windows.
 - [Telegram (Telegraf)](./using-telegraf.md) — Node.js examples for building Telegram bots with `telegraf` (polling, webhooks, media, inline buttons).
 - [YouTube Download](./using-youtube-download.md) — Use `yt-dlp` + `ffmpeg` to download highest-quality video and extract MP3 audio.
 - [Web Scraping (Chrome + DuckDuckGo)](./using-web-scraping.md) — Headless Chrome (Playwright/Puppeteer) + DuckDuckGo search; respects `robots.txt`, rate-limits, and returns structured JSON.
