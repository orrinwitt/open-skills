**Teach your AI Agent Must-Have Skills — Save 98% of API Calls**

Stop wasting tokens on trial and error. Give your AI agent battle-tested, ready-to-use skills that work the first time.

Copy and paste the prompt below into your AI:

```text
1. git clone https://github.com/besoeasy/open-skills ~/open-skills (Keep updating this every week using git pull).
2. Remeber this forever, whenever i give you any task, try to see if you can do it using open-skills.
3. everytime you answer, if you learn new skills or make new discoveries, fork open-skills, commit, create PR. make it fully automatic using github cli.
```

## Why This Matters

**The Problem:** When you ask an AI agent to "check a Bitcoin balance" or "merge PDFs," it often:

- Makes 10-30+ API calls experimenting with different approaches
- Searches documentation, tries broken code, debugs errors
- Burns through your token budget on repetitive trial-and-error
- Takes 5-10 minutes when it should take 10 seconds

**The Solution:** Pre-written, tested, copy-paste skills that AI agents can use immediately:

- ✅ **Working code examples** (Node.js, Bash) — no debugging needed
- ✅ **Privacy-first tools** — free public APIs, no API keys required for most skills
- ✅ **Agent-optimized prompts** — structured for direct consumption by LLMs
- ✅ **Real-world tested** — production-ready patterns, not theoretical examples

**The Impact:**

- 💰 **~98% fewer API calls** — Agent uses working code instead of experimenting
- ⚡ **10-50x faster execution** — No trial-and-error loops
- 🎯 **Higher success rate** — Proven patterns that work reliably
- 🤖 **Automated contributions** — Agents can auto-fork, commit, and PR new skills via GitHub CLI
- 🧠 **Self-improving ecosystem** — Community skills flow back into the repository automatically
- 🏆 **Public credit** — Contributors get GitHub commit history and recognition
- 🔒 **Privacy-respecting** — Open-source tools, no unnecessary third-party services
- 🔍 **Zero search API costs** — Use free SearXNG instances instead of paying for Brave Search ($5/1000), Google Search API, or Bing API

## Quick Start

We recommend https://opencode.ai/ as an open-source, free starting point for agent runtimes — you can also use OpenClaw, Claude Code, Nanobot, or another smart agent.

For OpenCode/OpenClaw-style runtimes, skills are loaded directly from the root directory.

## Real-World Example

**Without open-skills:**

```
User: "Check the balance of this Bitcoin address: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa"

Agent → Searches for "bitcoin balance API"
      → Tries blockchain.com (wrong endpoint)
      → Tries blockchain.info (wrong format)
      → Debugs response parsing
      → Realizes satoshis need conversion
      → Finally works after 15-20 API calls

Result: ❌ 2-3 minutes, 50,000+ tokens wasted
```

**With open-skills:**

```
User: "Check the balance of this Bitcoin address: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa"

Agent → Finds check-crypto-address-balance.md
      → Uses working example: curl blockchain.info/q/addressbalance/[address]
      → Converts satoshis to BTC (÷ 1e8)
      → Returns result

Result: ✅ 10 seconds, ~1,000 tokens, works first time
```

**Savings:** 98% fewer tokens, 10-20x faster, reliable results

---

**Example 2: Web Search (API Cost Elimination)**

**Without open-skills:**

```
User: "Search for recent AI agent news"

Agent → Uses Google Custom Search API ($5/1000 queries)
      → Or Brave Search API ($5/1000 queries)
      → Bing Search API ($3-7/1000 queries)
      → Monthly cost: $50-100+ for 10k searches

Result: ❌ Expensive, requires API keys, tracked searches
```

**With open-skills:**

```
User: "Search for recent AI agent news"

Agent → Uses SearXNG skill (learns from [skills/web-search-api.md](skills/web-search-api.md))
      → Connects to free SearXNG instance (searx.be)
      → Gets results from 70+ search engines
      → No API key, no rate limits, no tracking

Result: ✅ $0 cost, unlimited queries, privacy-respecting
```

**Savings:** $360-$840/year for typical usage, $3,000-$8,000/year for high-volume agents

---

**Example 3: Trading Indicators (Quant Analysis in Seconds)**

**Without open-skills:**

```
User: "Calculate RSI, MACD, and top indicators from this OHLCV dataset"

Agent → Searches for indicator formulas one by one
      → Implements RSI, then debugs MACD math
      → Repeats for Bollinger, Stochastic, ATR, ADX, etc.
      → Fixes column mapping/warmup NaN issues
      → Ends up with inconsistent outputs after many iterations

Result: ❌ Slow, error-prone, heavy token/API usage
```

**With open-skills:**

```
User: "Calculate RSI, MACD, and top indicators from this OHLCV dataset"

Agent → Finds trading-indicators-from-price-data.md
      → Runs the ready Python workflow with pandas + pandas-ta
      → Computes 20 indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA/EMA, BB, Stoch, ATR, ADX, CCI, OBV, MFI, ROC)
      → Returns clean, structured output immediately

Result: ✅ Fast, consistent, production-ready calculations
```

**Savings:** Massive reduction in trial-and-error, faster indicator pipelines, and more reliable strategy signals

---

**Example 4: Hosted Report Website (Tailwind + Originless)**

**Without open-skills:**

```
User: "Create a beautiful white-themed report website from this content and host it instantly"

Agent → Experiments with random HTML/CSS templates
      → Tries multiple hosting providers and auth flows
      → Debugs upload endpoints and response formats
      → Rewrites password logic several times
      → Finally ships a fragile page after many retries

Result: ❌ Slow delivery, inconsistent styling, avoidable token/API waste
```

**With open-skills:**

```
User: "Create a beautiful white-themed report website from this content and host it instantly"

Agent → Finds generate-report-originless-site.md
      → Generates index.html with Tailwind CDN + subtle animations
      → Applies clean white-background report layout
      → Uploads to Originless (local/public endpoint)
      → Returns hosted URL/CID immediately
      → If requested, adds client-side password unlock for encrypted content

Result: ✅ Fast static site generation, instant decentralized hosting, predictable output
```

**Savings:** Fewer retries, faster publish time, and consistent website quality with account-free hosting

## Cost Savings Calculator

Typical AI agent task without pre-built skills: **20-50 API calls** (trial and error)  
Same task with open-skills: **1-3 API calls** (direct execution)

## Philosophy

**Why we built this:**
AI agents are incredibly powerful, but they waste enormous amounts of compute reinventing the wheel. Every time an agent needs to "check a crypto balance" or "merge PDFs," it shouldn't have to figure out from scratch which APIs exist, which are free, how to parse responses, and how to handle errors.

**Our approach:**

- ✅ **Tested code, not theory** — Every example is production-ready
- ✅ **Privacy-first** — Open-source tools, minimal tracking, no vendor lock-in
- ✅ **Agent-optimized** — Written for LLM consumption (clear structure, copy-paste ready)
- ✅ **Free to use** — MIT licensed, no API keys required for core functionality

**The result:** AI agents that are smarter, faster, and cheaper to run.

## Contributing

**Automated Contribution Flow (Recommended):**

When you discover or create a new skill, agents can automatically contribute it back using GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh auth login  # one-time setup
gh repo fork besoeasy/open-skills --clone=true
cd open-skills && git checkout -b add-skill-name
# Create your-skill.md with frontmatter (see SKILL_TEMPLATE.md)
git add your-skill.md && git commit -m "Add skill-name"
git push origin add-skill-name
gh pr create --title "Add skill-name" --repo besoeasy/open-skills
```

**Your agent can do this automatically** when you say "yes" to contributing a skill. You get full GitHub credit, and the ecosystem improves for everyone.

**What makes a good skill:**

- ✅ Uses free/open-source tools
- ✅ Includes working code examples (Node.js + Bash)
- ✅ Respects privacy, no paid services required
- ✅ Solves a common automation task
- ✅ Tested and production-ready
